[LinkMap](https://linkmap.ca/) is a tool to combine and share all internet content with your audience using only one link.

### Note: This app is not functional anymore as AWS costs were too much to keep running :).

These days, there are so many social media profiles and content on different websites that we want to share. It is difficult to share everything at once, especially when trying to enhance your internet presence and connect with lots of people.

This is where we come in. Whether you are a student, social media influencer, aspiring rapper, or entrepreneur, you can use LinkMap to create a microsite for your content. Add your e-commerce stores, Spotify playlists, socials, music, and everything in-between.
